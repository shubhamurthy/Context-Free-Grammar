# Context-Free-Grammar
A sentence generator with a potentially infinite number of sentence structures, that uses random words of different parts of speech.

All sentences essentially use a basic NP-VP-(PP) or NP-"is"-Adj-(PP), with PP always being optional.

To use, open index.html and click on the button that says "click to generate a new sentence".
